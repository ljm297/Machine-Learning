# Binary Image Classifier for Guilty Dog

This is a binary image classifier trained and tested on a small dataset. The goal is to determine whether a dog has a "guilty face" or not. Main models adpoted are convolutional neural network CNN, support vector machine SVM, and CNN-SVM. CNN is built via Keras.
